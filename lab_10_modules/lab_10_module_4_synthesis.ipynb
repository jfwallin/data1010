    "1. **Well-established facts with broad agreement**\n",
    "   - Example: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",

    "3. **Commonsense reasoning**\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Specific citations or sources are requested**\n",
    "   - AI often fabricates paper titles, authors, or case law\n",
    "   - Always verify citations independently\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Recent events or current information**\n",
    "   - AI training has a cutoff date (often months or years old)\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Numerical data or statistics**\n",
    "   - AI may confidently state wrong numbers\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **Ambiguous or underspecified questions**\n",
    "   - AI may guess what you meant and answer the wrong question\n",
    "   - Be specific in your prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Niche or specialized domains**\n",
    "   - Less training data = higher error rates\n",
    "   - Domain expertise is essential for verification\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Multi-step reasoning chains**\n",
    "   - AI can make logical errors in complex reasoning\n",

    "**For Numerical Data:**\n",
    "1. Find the original data source (government statistics, research papers)\n",
