    "   - AI often fabricates paper titles, authors, or case law\n",
    "   - Always verify citations independently\n",

    "\n",
    "You've completed an investigation into AI self-assessment and discovered several critical insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Core Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AI Confidence ≠ AI Accuracy**\n",
    "   - AI can sound very confident while being completely wrong\n",
    "   - Tone and caveats are unreliable indicators of correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Systematic Weaknesses Exist**\n",
    "   - Citation requests often trigger hallucinations\n",
    "   - Ambiguous questions lead to confident but potentially wrong answers\n",
    "   - Recent events exceed training data boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Overconfidence is Common**\n",
    "   - In your data, you likely found cases where AI was confident but wrong\n",
    "   - This pattern appears across different models and contexts\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **AI Cannot Reliably Self-Assess**\n",
    "   - AI cannot consistently predict when it will make mistakes\n",
    "   - Meta-predictions about AI behavior are themselves unreliable\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Practical Guidelines for AI Use\n",
    "\n",
    "**Always Verify When:**\n",
    "- Stakes are high (academic, professional, medical, legal)\n",
    "- Specific sources or citations are provided\n",
    "- Numerical data or statistics are given\n",
    "- Information relates to recent events\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trust But Verify:**\n",
    "- Use multiple independent sources\n",
    "- Check original sources, not summaries\n",
    "- Apply domain knowledge to spot implausible claims\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use AI Effectively:**\n",
    "- Great for brainstorming and initial research\n",
    "- Excellent for explaining concepts\n",
    "- Useful for generating ideas and drafts\n",
    "- **But always verify critical information**\n",

    "### 🔬 Connection to Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab connects to broader themes in DATA 1010:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation:** AI systems are evaluated on accuracy, but calibration (confidence matching accuracy) is equally important\n",

    "- **Human-AI Collaboration:** AI is a tool that requires human judgment and verification\n",
    "- **Responsible AI:** Understanding limitations is essential for ethical deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌍 Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI becomes more prevalent:\n",
    "- Critical thinking and verification skills become more valuable\n",
