## 1. Audience & Context

DATA 1010 serves **first-year college students** with:

- **A wide range of prior experience**
  (from zero coding exposure to strong CS backgrounds)

- **No prerequisites** in computer science, math, or programming

- **High variation** in study habits, confidence, and motivation

- **Interest** in learning how modern AI works through hands-on exploration

### Lab Component Objectives

The lab component is intended to:

- **Lower the barrier of entry** for non-CS students
- **Challenge and enrich** students with stronger backgrounds
- **Build conceptual foundation** before mathematical or formal models
- **Provide repeated experience** with feedback-driven exploration, prediction, and explanation

---

## 2. Overall Goals for the Lab Sequence

### A. Build Core AI Intuition

Students should emerge with **intuitive mastery** of:

- **Error, loss, and optimization** — understanding how machines measure and minimize mistakes
- **Model behavior and decision boundaries** — recognizing how models partition input space
- **Embeddings, similarity, and representation** — grasping how data is transformed for learning
- **Multimodal inputs and outputs** — working with text, images, audio, and structured data
- **Evaluation, uncertainty, and explainability** — assessing model quality and limitations
- **Limits, failure modes, and bias** — recognizing when and why AI systems fail
- **Prediction and learning as iterative refinement** — seeing learning as continuous feedback-driven improvement

> **Key Principle:** The labs are designed to foster *thinking like an AI practitioner* before "writing code like one."

### B. Build Computational Confidence

By the end of the semester, students should:

- **Comfortably navigate** Google Colab
- **Read, modify, and run** Python cells
- **Interpret** plots and visual output
- **Understand** how small changes propagate in models

Labs are designed to be **approachable** and **redundancy-safe** — not dependent on heavy install steps or fragile toolchains.

### C. Emphasize Conceptual Learning, Not Coding Mechanics

The course does **NOT** aim to teach Python deeply or turn students into programmers.

Instead, coding is used as a lens for:

- **Exploration** — discovering patterns and behaviors
- **Visualization** — making abstract concepts concrete
- **Experimentation** — testing ideas and hypotheses
- **Reasoning** — developing mental models of how systems work

> **Design Philosophy:** Where AI instruction often hides computation, this course *demystifies* it through controlled, guided exposure.

### D. Encourage Prediction → Experiment → Explanation

Across the entire sequence, labs share a common **cognitive loop**:

#### 1. **Prediction**
Students anticipate what a model or parameter change will do.

#### 2. **Experiment**
Students run code, adjust parameters, test ideas, gather feedback.

#### 3. **Explanation**
Students articulate reasoning about what happened and why.

This pattern reinforces **scientific reasoning** and helps students **internalize AI concepts**.

### E. Support Group Collaboration

Labs are structured so that:

- Students work in **groups of 2–4**
- Roles are **flexible** (not rigid)
- Tasks encourage **discussion**, not division of labor
- Each student participates in **prediction and explanation**

Group work prioritizes:

- **Sensemaking** — making sense of observations together
- **Shared reasoning** — thinking through problems collaboratively
- **Collaborative discovery** — finding insights as a team
- **Peer teaching** — explaining concepts to one another

## 4. The Cognitive Loop: Predict → Experiment → Explain

This three-phase loop is the **pedagogical core** of the lab sequence.

### Phase 1: Prediction

**What students do:**
- Make explicit hypotheses
- Discuss with group
- Record predictions

**Example prompts:**
- "Before running this cell, predict: will the error increase or decrease?"
- "Which parameter (slope or intercept) will have a bigger effect on the fit?"
- "If we use a larger learning rate, what will happen to the optimization?"

**Why it matters:**
- **Activates prior knowledge**
- **Creates cognitive dissonance** when predictions are wrong (learning opportunity)
- **Engages** students in the process
- **Develops intuition** before seeing results

### Phase 2: Experiment

**What students do:**
- Run code cells
- Adjust parameters
- Observe visualizations
- Gather data
- Test variations

**Design principles:**
- **Immediate feedback** (results appear quickly)
- **Safe to fail** (no wrong answers, just observations)
- **Low-friction** (sliders, not code editing)
- **Visual** (plots, animations, colors)

**Why it matters:**
- **Hands-on learning** is more memorable
- **Discovery** feels rewarding
- **Variability** shows patterns
- **Iteration** builds fluency

### Phase 3: Explanation

**What students do:**
- Articulate what happened
- Explain why it happened
- Connect to concepts
- Identify patterns

**Example prompts:**
- "Why did the loss decrease when you changed X?"
- "How does this relate to what we learned about optimization?"
- "What would you tell a friend who asked how this works?"

**Why it matters:**
- **Consolidates understanding**
- **Reveals misconceptions**
- **Develops communication skills**
- **Deepens learning** through articulation

### Facilitating the Loop

**Instructor role:**
- **Model the loop** in demonstrations
- **Use consistent language** ("Let's predict...", "Now experiment...", "Can you explain...?")
- **Validate effort** in all phases
- **Probe deeper** with follow-up questions
- **Connect** to bigger picture

**Common pitfalls:**
- Students skip prediction and jump to experiment
- Students observe but don't explain
- Groups split work instead of collaborating
- Focus on "getting it right" instead of understanding

**Solutions:**
- **Require** prediction before revealing experiment cell
- **Pause** after experiments for discussion
- **Structure** questions to require group consensus
- **Emphasize** process over correctness

## 5. Assessment & Learning Outcomes

### Assessment Philosophy

- **Low-stakes, high-feedback**
- **Process over product**
- **Understanding over correctness**
- **Growth-oriented**

### Assessment Components

| Component | Weight | Purpose |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Pre-Lab Quiz** | 5–10% | Readiness check, vocabulary |
| **In-Lab Participation** | 20–30% | Engagement, collaboration |
| **Post-Lab Reflection** | 30–40% | Conceptual understanding |
| **Lab Practical** (midterm/final) | 30–40% | Synthesis, application |

### Learning Outcomes by Lab

Each lab should have **3–5 specific learning outcomes**:

**Example (Lab 1 on Error and Optimization):**

By the end of this lab, students should be able to:

1. **Explain** how error is measured at a single data point vs. globally
2. **Describe** why we square errors instead of adding raw residuals
3. **Predict** how changing model parameters affects total loss
4. **Demonstrate** how optimization uses only loss values (not the data directly)
5. **Connect** line-fitting optimization to broader ML training

### Measuring Success

**Formative indicators:**
- Students make thoughtful predictions
- Groups discuss reasoning actively
- Explanations show conceptual understanding
- Students connect to prior labs

**Summative indicators:**
- Post-lab reflections show depth
- Lab practicals demonstrate transfer
- Students can explain concepts to peers
- Course evaluations highlight understanding

## 6. Instructor Preparation & Resources

### Before Each Lab

**1 week before:**
- [ ] Review lab notebook end-to-end
- [ ] Test all interactive widgets
- [ ] Prepare any handouts
- [ ] Post pre-lab materials to LMS

**1 day before:**
- [ ] Re-run notebook in Colab to ensure functionality

### During Lab

**Opening:**
- Briefly review pre-lab concept (don't re-teach)
- Address any setup issues quickly
- Set expectations for group work

**While groups work:**
- **Circulate actively** — visit each group multiple times
- **Listen before intervening** — let groups struggle productively
- **Ask probing questions** instead of giving answers
- **Note common issues** for whole-class discussion
- **Watch for groups that are stuck** vs. struggling productively

**Common situations:**

| Situation | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Group is off-task | Redirect with question: "What are you predicting for this next part?" |
| One student dominating | "Let's hear from [quieter student] — what do you think?" |
| Technical error | "What does the error message say? Can anyone in the group interpret it?" |
| Conceptual confusion | Don't explain directly — ask group to discuss, then guide |
| Moving too fast | "Before you move on, can you explain to each other what just happened?" |
| Stuck | Provide small hint or ask scaffolding question, not full answer |

**Closing:**
- Bring class together 10 min before end
- Highlight 2–3 key insights from the lab
- Preview post-lab questions
- Note connections to next lab

### After Lab
