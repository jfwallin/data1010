    "# Lab 6, Module 2: Image Saliency with MobileNetV2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Estimated time:** 20 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Opening: From Words to Pixels**\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Module 1**, you learned how to find which **words** matter most for text predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's ask the same question for images:\n",
    "\n",
    "> When a model classifies an image as \"Golden Retriever\", **which pixels** drove that decision?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why This Matters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a medical AI that analyzes X-rays for lung cancer. If it achieves 95% accuracy, that's impressive—but:\n",
    "- **Is it looking at the lung tissue?** ✓ Good\n",
    "- **Or is it focusing on the hospital logo in the corner?** ✗ Spurious correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "Saliency maps let us **see what the model sees**—revealing both successes and failures.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 📘 **How Image Saliency Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike text (where we could just remove words), we can't simply \"delete\" pixels. Instead, we use **gradients**—remember them from Lab 2?\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Core Idea:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from **Lab 2** that gradients measure **sensitivity to changes**:\n",
    "- When training, we compute gradients with respect to **weights** (how to change parameters)\n",
    "- For saliency, we compute gradients with respect to **input pixels** (which pixels affect the output most)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Math (Intuition Only, No Calculus Required):**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Saliency(pixel) = How much would the class score change if we changed this pixel slightly?\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High gradient** → small pixel change → big prediction change → **important pixel**\n",
    "- **Low gradient** → small pixel change → no prediction change → **unimportant pixel**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Visual Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "For an image of a dog:\n",
    "- **Ears, snout, eyes:** High saliency (distinctive dog features)\n",
    "- **Grass, sky background:** Low saliency (doesn't help identify \"dog\")\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 **Setup: Loading a Pre-Trained Image Classifier**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use **MobileNetV2**, a lightweight image classifier:\n",
    "- Pre-trained on **ImageNet** (1.4 million images, 1000 classes)\n",
    "- Recognizes objects like dogs, cats, vehicles, food, etc.\n",
    "- Only **14 MB** in size (perfect for Colab!)\n",
    "- Runs on CPU in ~2 seconds per image\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a production-quality model used in mobile apps and edge devices."

    "## ⚠️ **When Saliency Reveals Problems**\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes saliency maps reveal that models focus on the **wrong features**. This is called **spurious correlation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-World Example: Medical Imaging**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** An AI trained to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays achieved 90% accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Saliency revealed:** The model focused on:\n",
    "- Hospital logos and watermarks in the corners\n",
    "- Patient positioning markers\n",
    "- Image quality artifacts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** Different hospitals used different imaging equipment. Certain hospitals happened to have more pneumonia cases. The model learned to recognize **hospitals** instead of **lung pathology**!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:** Retrain with more diverse data, remove watermarks, use data augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Another Example: Husky vs. Wolf**\n",
    "\n",
    "A famous case study found that a \"Husky vs. Wolf\" classifier focused on:\n",

    "### **What's Similar:**\n",
    "- Both measure **sensitivity**: how much the prediction changes when we change the input\n",
    "- Both reveal **which features matter most**\n",
    "- Both help **debug models** and **detect spurious correlations**\n",

    "### **What's Different:**\n",
    "- Text is **discrete** (remove whole words) vs. images are **continuous** (use gradients)\n",
    "- Text has clear **semantic units** (words) vs. pixels have no inherent meaning\n",
    "- Text saliency is **sparse** (few important words) vs. image saliency is **dense** (regions of pixels)\n",
