NARRATIVE REVIEW - Lab 4 Module 2 v3
=====================================

CELL 11 - Algorithm Explanation (NEW)
--------------------------------------
How Gradient Descent Works: Simple Rules, Powerful Results

The Algorithm (in plain English):
1. Forward pass: Calculate prediction from current weights
2. Compute error: How wrong is the prediction?
3. Backpropagation: Calculate which direction to adjust each weight
4. Update weights: Take a small step in that direction
5. Repeat until error is small enough

The math behind it:
- Derivatives tell us which direction makes error smaller
- Chain rule connects output error back to every weight
- Learning rate controls step size (too big = unstable, too small = slow)

Despite ~100 lines of code, it's just these 5 steps repeated!

Why Multiple Starting Points?
The loss landscape has hills and valleys. Gradient descent rolls downhill from wherever it starts:
- Good starting point: Near a deep valley (converges quickly)
- Bad starting point: On a plateau or shallow valley (gets stuck)

Multi-start strategy: Try 10 random starts, pick the one with lowest initial loss.
This gives us the best "head start" down the hill!

--------------------------------------

CELL 15 - Smart Initialization (ENHANCED)
------------------------------------------
Smart Initialization Strategy

When you click "Reset Network", the system tries 10 different random starting points
and automatically picks the one with the lowest initial loss. This is called multi-start initialization.

Why this helps:
- The loss landscape is like a bumpy terrain with many hills and valleys
- Some random starting points are near deep valleys (good!) = fast convergence
- Others are on plateaus or shallow valleys (bad!) = slow or no convergence
- By trying multiple starts, we increase the odds of finding a good valley

The intuition:
- Imagine dropping 10 balls randomly on a hilly landscape
- Each ball rolls to a different local low point
- We pick the ball that found the deepest valley to start from
- This gives gradient descent the best chance to find a great solution!

Try this:
1. Train until convergence or until stuck (loss stops decreasing)
2. If stuck, click "Reset Network" to get a fresh starting point
3. Notice how the initial loss varies - some starting points are much better!
4. Compare: Does momentum help escape bad starting points?

--------------------------------------

KEY NARRATIVE IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Cell 1: Added "key insight" that complex code is just 4 simple steps repeated
2. Cell 11: NEW - Explains algorithm clearly, emphasizes simplicity, explains multi-start
3. Cell 15: ENHANCED - Better landscape analogy, ball-dropping intuition
4. Throughout: Consistent metaphor of "rolling downhill" in loss landscape
