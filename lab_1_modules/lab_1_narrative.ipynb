    "\n",
    "In this course, the word **model** has a very specific meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **model** is a rule, formula, or pattern that **makes predictions** based on input values.  A model isn't \"reality,\", but it attempts to closely capture how a set of data behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples of simple models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A straight line:  \n",
    "  `prediction = m * x + b`\n",
    "- A rule like “every hour the temperature drops by 2 degrees.”\n",
    "- A computer program that takes an image and predicts what object is in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A model has **parameters** — numbers that control how it behaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For a line, the parameters are the **slope** `m` and **intercept** `b`.\n",
    "- In more complicated models (like neural networks), there can be millions of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What models do\n",
    "\n",
    "A model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Takes input**  \n",
    "   (for example, a value of `x`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Produces a prediction**  \n",
    "   (for example, a predicted value of `y`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Can be adjusted**  \n",
    "   by changing its parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we adjust models\n",
    "\n",
    "If a model’s predictions do not match the data very well, we adjust the parameters to make it better.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the model does *not* know whether its guesses look “right.”  \n",
    "It only receives one piece of information: **the total error** (loss) based on the differences between prediction and data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we spend so much time defining error and loss — these numbers tell the model how to improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **model** is a system that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- makes predictions,\n",
    "- depends on adjustable parameters, and\n",
    "- is improved by reducing its total error on data.\n",

    "## Understanding Error and Total Error (Loss)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start fitting models, we need a clear idea of **what “error” means**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.1 Error at a Single Data Point**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a true value from data: `actual`,  \n",
    "- a predicted value from our model: `predicted`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **error** at that point is simply the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive error means the model predicted too *low*.  \n",
    "Negative error means the model predicted too *high*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.2 Why We Don’t Just Add These Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we add all the raw errors for a dataset, something bad happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "- some errors are positive,\n",
    "- some are negative,\n",
    "- and they can cancel each other out even if the model is doing a terrible job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "If one point is off by +5 and another is off by –5, the total would look like “0”,  \n",
    "even though both points are badly wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "We don’t want cancellations — we want a measure of **how wrong** the model is overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.3 Squaring Errors to Make Them All Positive**\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, we **square** each individual error:\n",
    "\n",
    "squared_error = (actual – predicted)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This has three important effects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All errors become **positive**, so nothing cancels out.\n",
    "- Larger mistakes become **much more noticeable** (a big miss matters more than a small one).\n",
    "- The math works out nicely later when we do optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.4 Total Error (also called Loss)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure how well a model fits *all* the data points, we combine the squared errors:\n",
    "total_error = squared_error_1 + squared_error_2 + squared_error_3 + ...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often called the **loss**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **good** model has a **small** total error.  \n",
    "A **bad** model has a **large** total error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1.5 Why We Use Total Error in Optimization**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we’re adjusting model parameters (like slope and intercept), the only thing the computer “looks at” is the **total error**. It doesn’t see the data points or the line shape the way a person does.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimizer tries different values, checks the total error, and tries to reduce that number.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why understanding *how* we compute error is essential — it becomes the entire “signal” that guides learning.\n",
