## Section 3: Watch Learning Happen! (8-10 min)

Now let's see gradient descent in action. You'll watch the network **learn** to solve XOR automatically.

### What You'll See:
- **Left panel**: Decision boundary evolving in real-time
- **Right panel**: Loss decreasing as the network learns
- **Training controls**: Step through learning at your own pace

### Smart Initialization Strategy

When you click **"Reset Network"**, the system tries **10 different random starting points** and automatically picks the one with the lowest initial loss. This is called **multi-start initialization**.

**Why this helps:**
- The loss landscape is like a bumpy terrain with many hills and valleys
- Some random starting points are near deep valleys (good!) → fast convergence
- Others are on plateaus or shallow valleys (bad!) → slow or no convergence
- By trying multiple starts, we increase the odds of finding a good valley

**The intuition:**
- Imagine dropping 10 balls randomly on a hilly landscape
- Each ball rolls to a different local low point
- We pick the ball that found the **deepest valley** to start from
- This gives gradient descent the best chance to find a great solution!

**Real-world machine learning:**
- Training often uses smart initialization strategies (Xavier, He initialization)
- Advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSprop) adapt learning rates automatically
- Large models sometimes run multiple training sessions and pick the best result

**Try this:**
1. Train until convergence or until stuck (loss stops decreasing)
2. If stuck, click "Reset Network" to get a fresh starting point
3. Notice how the initial loss varies - some starting points are much better!
4. Compare: Does momentum help escape bad starting points?
