    "## Welcome to Lab 11: Human-AI Collaboration for Creative Problem Solving\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll discover an important truth about AI systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **AI is excellent at generating content, but struggles to evaluate its own work.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work through a complete collaborative workflow:\n",
    "1. **Generate**: Use AI to create content\n",
    "2. **Evaluate**: Apply explicit criteria to judge quality\n",
    "3. **Revise**: Improve the content based on feedback\n",
    "4. **Reflect**: Understand when to trust AI vs. maintain human oversight\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Makes This Lab Unique?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous labs where you've analyzed AI from the outside, today you'll **actively collaborate** with AI—testing its strengths and discovering its blind spots through hands-on work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lab, you will:\n",
    "- Understand that **generation is easier than evaluation**\n",
    "- Apply **explicit rubrics** to evaluate content quality\n",
    "- Recognize that **AI self-evaluation is unreliable**\n",
    "- Use AI as a **revision tool** with human oversight\n",
    "- Articulate when to **trust AI vs. maintain human judgment**"
