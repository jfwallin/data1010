That was enough to see the core idea: words that appear in similar contexts get similar vectors.\n\n**Now let's scale up.**\n\nIn this module, you'll work with **GloVe** (Global Vectors for Word Representation), a professional embedding model trained on:\n- **6 billion tokens** from Wikipedia and web text\n- **400,000 vocabulary words**\n- **50-dimensional vectors** (much more compact than our 92×92 matrix!)\n\nThese embeddings capture fascinating patterns in language, including:\n- Which dimensions correspond to concepts like \"science-ness\" or \"formality\"\n- **Vector arithmetic** that solves analogies: *paris - france + italy ≈ rome*\n- Relationships between word families, tenses, and grammatical forms\n\n**What you'll explore:**\n1. Load pre-trained GloVe word vectors\n2. Examine individual word embeddings\n3. Investigate what individual dimensions capture\n4. Use vector arithmetic to solve analogies\n5. Try your own custom analogies\n\nLet's dive in!"

If a relationship isn't encoded consistently in the corpus, the model won't capture it.\n\nSo if your custom analogy fails, it doesn't mean you did it wrong—it often means the relationship isn't represented as a simple line in this embedding space.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Questions 11-15 (Analysis & Experimentation)\n\n**Q11.** After running the analogy code, was your prediction for Q10 correct?
