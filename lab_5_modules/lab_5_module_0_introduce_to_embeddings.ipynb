   "source": "# Lab 5, Module 0: Introduction to Embeddings\n\n**Estimated time:** 20 minutes\n\n---\n\n## **Opening: How Does Your Brain Know Meaning?**\n\nThink about this for a moment: How does your brain know that \"cat\" and \"dog\" are similar, but \"cat\" and \"galaxy\" are completely different? You've never explicitly been taught a rule that says \"pets go together\" and \"space objects go separately.\" Yet somehow, through experience, your brain has learned these relationships.\n\n**Modern AI systems like ChatGPT work the same way.** They don't store word definitions or rules. Instead, they represent words and sentences as **vectors**—lists of numbers—where similar meanings point in similar directions in a high-dimensional space.\n\nThis module gives you an intuitive, \"behind the curtain\" understanding of how that works.\n\n---\n\n# 📘 **How Do Embeddings Work?**  \n### *A simple, concrete explanation*\n\nModern AI systems (like ChatGPT and other foundation models) represent **words** and **sentences** as **vectors**—lists of numbers. These vectors encode meaning based on how language is used across millions of sentences.\n\n---\n\n## **1. Words become vectors using \"distributed meaning\"**\n\nEvery word (e.g., **\"galaxy\"**) becomes a long list of numbers:\n\n$[0.12, -0.88, 0.43, ... , 0.04]$\n\nEach number captures a tiny statistical association learned from language use.\n\nYou can think of each dimension as asking a vague, fuzzy question like:\n\n- **\"How strongly does this idea tend to appear in scientific or technical contexts?\"**\n- **\"How much does this concept appear in discussions about animals?\"**\n- **\"How much does this idea align with everyday activities or objects?\"**\n\nNo single dimension has a clean human meaning.  \nBut **together**, they form a rich representation of the word's usage patterns.\n\nWords used in similar ways end up with **similar vectors**.\n\n---\n\n## **2. The model learns meaning by predicting missing words**\n\nEmbedding models are typically trained with a simple game:\n\n> **Look at a sentence with a missing word and guess what goes there.**\n\nExample:\n\n*\"The _____ orbits the Sun every year.\"*\n\nThe model is rewarded for predicting words like:\n- *Earth*\n- *planet*\n- *object*\n\nand penalized for predicting:\n- *banana*\n- *giraffe*\n\nAfter doing this **millions of times**, the model learns patterns such as:\n\n- Which words appear in similar contexts  \n- Which words are interchangeable in certain situations  \n- How tone, topic, and structure influence meaning  \n\nThis process pulls related words together in vector space.\n\n---\n\n## **3. Sentences become vectors too**\n\nEmbedding models for sentences (like the one you'll use in Module 2) work by:\n\n1. Converting each word into a vector  \n2. Processing the whole sentence through a small transformer  \n3. Producing one final vector that represents the meaning of the sentence  \n\nTwo sentences with the *same meaning* end up very close:\n\n- \"The Earth orbits the Sun.\"  \n- \"The Sun is orbited by the Earth.\"\n\nEven though the wording is different.\n\n---\n\n## **4. Measuring similarity: cosine similarity**\n\nTo compare meanings, we use **cosine similarity**, which measures the angle between two vectors:\n\n- **1.0** → almost identical meaning  \n- **0.8** → very similar  \n- **0.4** → loosely related  \n- **0.0** → unrelated  \n\nThis is the core idea behind semantic search:  \n> Find the corpus sentences whose vectors are closest to the query vector.\n\n---\n\n## **5. The big picture: why this matters**\n\n- Embeddings are **numerical fingerprints of meaning**.  \n- Similar meanings → similar vectors.  \n- The model learns this automatically through massive exposure to language.  \n- Geometry (distances and directions) encodes semantic relationships.  \n- This is the same idea as **hidden representations** from Lab 4—  \n  just scaled up to hundreds of millions of parameters.\n\n**Connection to Lab 4:** Remember how hidden layers in neural networks created new representations that made problems solvable? Embeddings do the same thing, but for language. They transform words into a space where \"meaning\" becomes measurable geometry."

   "source": "# Building Our Own Tiny Embedding System\n\n## Why Build from Scratch?\n\nYou might wonder: \"If professional embedding models exist, why build our own?\"\n\n**Answer:** Building the simplest possible version helps you understand the core idea. Once you see how a tiny 27-sentence embedding system works, you'll understand what GloVe, BERT, and GPT are doing—just at a much larger scale.\n\nThink of this as building a bicycle before learning to fly a plane. Same basic principles, different scale.\n\n---\n\n## 🧱 How We Create an Embedding Matrix (Simple Example)\n\nTo understand how word embeddings work, we start by building a **co-occurrence matrix**.  \nThis matrix captures *how often words appear near each other* in our tiny corpus.\n\n### 1. Build an empty matrix\nWe create a matrix with one row and one column for every word in the vocabulary.\n\nIf we have 92 words, this becomes a **92 × 92** table.\n\n- **Rows** represent the \"target\" word  \n- **Columns** represent the \"context\" word  \n- Entries store **how many times** they appear together\n\nAt the start, everything is zero.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Fill the matrix by counting co-occurrences\nFor each sentence:\n\n1. Split it into words  \n2. For every pair of words in that sentence  \n3. Add **+1** to the cell for (word₁, word₂)\n\nExample sentence: *\"cats chase mice\"*\n\nWe add +1 to: (cats, chase), (cats, mice), (chase, cats), (chase, mice), (mice, cats), (mice, chase)\n\n---\n\n### 3. The matrix becomes a simple embedding\nAfter processing all sentences:\n\n- Row **i** contains the \"context fingerprint\" of word *i*  \n- Words that appear in **similar contexts** have **similar rows**  \n- These rows *are* our first version of embeddings\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"cats\" and \"dogs\" may have similar rows because they appear next to \"pets,\" \"chase,\" etc.  \n- \"stars\" and \"galaxies\" may have similar rows because both appear near science words  \n- \"neural\" and \"networks\" will strongly co-occur\n\nThis creates meaningful structure without any neural networks.\n\n---\n\n## ⭐ 4. Why real embeddings reduce dimension (PCA, SVD, neural models)\n\nOur tiny embedding matrix is **vocab_size × vocab_size**.  \nWith a vocabulary of 50,000 words, that becomes a **50,000 × 50,000** matrix — far too big and noisy.\n\nReal embedding systems (word2vec, GloVe, MiniLM, BERT, GPT) therefore:\n\n### ✔ Learn a **much smaller number of dimensions**  \nusually **50–1000**, instead of tens of thousands.\n\n### ✔ Use mathematical tools to compress the co-occurrence structure:\n- **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** in GloVe  \n- **PCA-like dimensionality reduction**  \n- **Neural networks (skip-gram, transformers)** that learn compact vectors directly  \n\n### ✔ The goal is to keep the **important patterns**  \nand discard the noise.\n\nYou can think of this like:\n\n> \"Boiling down all the ways a word is used into a small, dense fingerprint of meaning.\"\n\nSo instead of each word having a 50,000-dimensional sparse vector,  \na model might learn a **384-dimensional** vector that captures the same semantic relationships.\n\nThis is why real embeddings:\n- are smaller  \n- generalize better  \n- work fast  \n- encode meaning in a compact geometric space  \n\nNow let's build our tiny embedding system and see this in action!"

   "source": "## 🔍 Understanding the PCA Plot: What You're Seeing\n\nThe interactive plot shows a **2-dimensional picture** of word embeddings that actually live in a **much higher-dimensional space** (92 dimensions in our case, one per vocabulary word). Because we can't easily visualize high-dimensional geometry, we use a tool called **Principal Component Analysis**, or **PCA**, to create a simplified view.\n\n### **What PCA Does (Intuition Only)**\nPCA looks at all of the high-dimensional word vectors and asks:\n\n> *\"If I had to draw these points on a flat piece of paper, what are the two directions that preserve the most structure?\"*\n\nIt then finds the two directions along which the words vary the most in meaning. These become the **x-axis** and **y-axis** of the plot.\n\nThink of PCA as:\n- flattening a crumpled map onto a table,  \n- while trying to keep neighborhoods and directions as faithful as possible.\n\n### **Why This Helps**\nEven though words actually live in a 92-dimensional space, PCA lets us see:\n\n- **clusters** of related words  \n  (e.g., pets cluster together: cats, dogs, hamsters)\n- **separation** between different topics  \n  (e.g., \"cats/dogs\" far from \"stars/galaxies\")\n- **relative similarity**  \n  (close points = similar contexts; far points = different meanings)\n\n### **What the Plot Represents**\n- Each **dot** is a word.  \n- Dots placed close together tend to appear in **similar contexts** in the corpus.  \n- Dots far apart rarely appear in similar contexts.  \n- Colors help highlight rough topic categories (pets=blue, space=red, tech=green, other=gray).\n\n**Notice how:**\n- Pet words (blue) cluster in one region\n- Space/astronomy words (red) cluster in another region\n- Technology words (green) form their own group\n- The clusters are separated from each other!\n\n### **Important Note**\nPCA doesn't capture *all* the meaning relationships—only the most visible ones.  \nWords might be similar in dimensions we can't visualize, but PCA gives us a useful snapshot that reveals the **general structure** of the embedding space.\n\nIn short:\n\n> **PCA gives us a 2D window into a high-dimensional world of meaning.**  \n> It's not perfect, but it's extremely helpful for seeing patterns and relationships at a glance.\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Questions 4-5 (Analysis)\n\n**Q4.** In the PCA visualization above, which words cluster together? Why do you think they form these groups?\n\n*Hint: Look at the colored regions. What do words in the same cluster have in common?*\n\n**Q5.** The original embedding space has 92 dimensions (one per word). PCA reduces this to 2D. What information might be lost in this reduction?\n\n*Think about: Can all word relationships be perfectly represented in just 2 dimensions?*\n\n*Record your answers in the answer sheet.*\n\n---"

   "source": "## 📝 Question 6 (Synthesis - Connection to Lab 4)\n\n**Q6.** How is this co-occurrence approach similar to what you learned about hidden layers in Lab 4? \n\n*Hint: Both create new representations. In Lab 4, hidden layers transformed input features into a new space. What does the co-occurrence matrix transform words into?*\n\n*Record your answer in the answer sheet.*\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Module 0 Complete!\n\nYou've just built a tiny embedding system from scratch! Here's what you learned:\n\n- **Words become vectors** based on which other words they appear with\n- **Similar contexts → similar vectors** (cats and dogs both appear with \"pets\")\n- **Cosine similarity** measures how close meanings are\n- **PCA** lets us visualize high-dimensional spaces in 2D\n- **This is the same core idea** that powers modern AI systems—just scaled up\n\n**In Module 1**, you'll explore pre-trained embeddings trained on BILLIONS of words from Wikipedia. You'll see how these professional embeddings capture fascinating relationships like analogies (king - man + woman = queen).\n\n**Ready?** Move on to **Module 1: Word Embeddings & Vector Arithmetic**!"
