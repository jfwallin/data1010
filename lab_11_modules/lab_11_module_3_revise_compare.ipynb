    "## Summary: What You've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Identified the 2 weakest criteria from Module 2\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Created a targeted revision prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Got AI to revise its work\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Scored the revised version using the same rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Compared original vs. revised systematically\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Identified improvements, regressions, and trade-offs\n",
    "\n",
    "✓ Made an overall judgment about quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "You've likely discovered:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit feedback helps**: When you give clear, rubric-based guidance, AI can often improve\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Trade-offs exist**: Improving one aspect sometimes makes another worse\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iteration has limits**: AI revision is useful but not perfect\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Human judgment remains essential**: You, not the AI, must decide if the revision is actually better\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bigger Picture\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is a **collaborator**, not an **authority**:\n",
    "- ✓ Good at generating drafts\n",
    "- ✓ Good at revising when given specific feedback\n",
    "- ✗ Poor at evaluating its own quality\n",
    "- ✗ Cannot reliably decide what's \"good\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Humans must provide the judgment, standards, and oversight.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Module 4 (Reflection)**, you will:\n",
    "- Synthesize your findings from all 3 stages\n",
    "- Read case studies about AI evaluation failures\n",
    "- Articulate when AI is a good collaborator vs. when humans must lead\n",
    "- Develop principles for responsible human-AI collaboration"
