    "\n",
    "In **Lab 5**, you learned how AI systems represent words as vectors—embeddings that capture meaning as geometry.\n",
    "\n",
    "But knowing that \"excellent\" and \"terrible\" have different embeddings doesn't tell us **which words drive a model's predictions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Today's Question:**\n",

    "\n",
    "In this module, you'll:\n",
    "1. Train a simple sentiment classifier on movie reviews\n",
    "2. Compute **word importance** by masking words one at a time\n",

    "\n",
    "The core idea is beautifully simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Get baseline prediction**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Sentence: \"The movie was excellent\"\n",
    "Model prediction: 95% positive\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 2: Remove one word at a time**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Remove \"The\":        \"movie was excellent\"     → 94% positive (change: -1%)\n",
    "Remove \"movie\":      \"The was excellent\"       → 92% positive (change: -3%)\n",
    "Remove \"was\":        \"The movie excellent\"     → 93% positive (change: -2%)\n",
    "Remove \"excellent\": \"The movie was\"           → 50% positive (change: -45%)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3: Measure importance**\n",
    "- **\"excellent\"** causes the biggest drop → **most important word** (45% impact)\n",
    "- **\"The\"** causes tiny drop → low importance (1% impact)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Insight:**\n",
    "> **The more the prediction changes when a word is removed, the more important that word is.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is called **leave-one-out** or **ablation** analysis. It's simple but effective!\n",
